>On days when the world

>seems to be getting on top of you,

>stop and look around,

>give someone a little hug

>and chase the world away.

>You would be suprised

>what a little hug can do.

>It can lift the weight

>off your shoulders

>and make you feel good to.

>So as your read this little poem, 

>give someone a little hug.

>They might need it

>just as much as you.
