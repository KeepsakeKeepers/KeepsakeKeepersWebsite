>I knew a song once,

>a long time ago.

>Such a lovely song -

>about love, and hope, and trust.

>The words echoed through my mind, 

>and the music, 

>the music captured my heart

>and set me dancing with joy.

>It was such a beautiful song -

>about love, and hope, and trust.

>Yes, I knew a song once,

>but time has passed

>and I no longer remember the words or the music.
