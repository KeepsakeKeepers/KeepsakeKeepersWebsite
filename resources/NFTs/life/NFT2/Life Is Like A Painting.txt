>Life is like a painting

>We can not satisfy

>Every viewer

>Someone will say

>It is abstract 

>And for another

>It is collage

>Some may say

>It is cubism

>Or Impressionism

>Or Surrealism

>But no one will say

>It is absurd

>Life is like a painting

>We can not satisfy

>Every viewer
