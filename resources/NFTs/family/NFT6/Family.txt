>I believe in you,

>More than any other.

>From then until now, 

>You are my family, 

>The best I have ever known,

>I swore to protect you,

>I will stake my life on yours.

>My trust in you,

>Unshakeable.

>My love for you,

>Unbreakable.

>Know that I will be there

>Whenever you need,

>Whenever you call.
