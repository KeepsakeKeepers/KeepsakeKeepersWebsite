>If you were an artist

>how would you paint me?

>With deep solid strokes

>or your brush sweeping softly?

>Would you paint me by number,

>quickly fill in the lines or

>sketch me first, taking your time?

>Would you use vibrant colors

>or plain shades of gray?

>Would you change me in anyway?

>Would you hang me proudly

>and gaze me often

>or tuck me away

>until I'm forgotten?
